# Todo list

Im going to have to learn react.js for this, aren't I

- build an interaction gateway as a module for app.js - so the site has something to communicate with
- don't forget to build fault tolerances, because the bot may not always be available
- Build a web interface using the github site
- Allow guild data to be cached, adding a time property
- add an owner property to each guild so the cache can be refreshed easily
- maybe add a donation method?
